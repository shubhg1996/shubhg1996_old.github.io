Designed and fabricated two robots capable of playing doubles badminton in a full-size badminton court.
* Developed an elbow-wrist movement inspired double-pneumatic mechanism for hitting shuttlecock over large distances.
* Worked on a system for generating the actuating signal for the mechanism by estimating the trajectory of the shuttlecock using a kinect sensor.
